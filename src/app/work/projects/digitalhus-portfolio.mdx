### Overview

The DigitalHus portfolio is my personal corner of the web, designed not just to list my work, but to be a statement of my brand and capabilities. The goal was to create an immersive, memorable experience that showcases my skills in UI/UX design, animation, and responsive front-end development.

### The Challenge

In a competitive tech market, a simple resume isn't enough. I needed a platform to:
- **Establish a professional brand:** Create a distinct visual identity that reflects my design philosophyâ€”modern, clean, and functional.
- **Demonstrate technical skills:** Go beyond a list of technologies and show them in action through a high-quality, performant website.
- **Tell my story:** Effectively communicate my unique transition from luxury hospitality to technology.

### My Role & The Solution

As the sole designer and developer, I was responsible for the entire project lifecycle, from concept to deployment.

1.  **Brand & UI Design:** I started by designing a brand identity, including a logo and color palette. I chose a dark gradient UI with glassmorphism to create a sense of depth and modernity. The design was prototyped in Figma.

2.  **Interactive Development:** I used **React** and **Next.js** for a performant foundation. To bring the site to life, I integrated **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** to create fluid, engaging animations.

3.  **Responsive Implementation:** I took a mobile-first approach, ensuring the site is fully responsive and provides a seamless experience across all devices.

### Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, HTML5, CSS3 (Sass), TypeScript
- **Animation:** GSAP
- **Design:** Figma
- **Deployment:** Vercel

### Results & Takeaways

- **Outcome:** A professional, high-performance portfolio that serves as the central hub for my professional identity.
- **Lesson Learned:** Balancing complex animations with web performance is a critical challenge. I learned to optimize GSAP animations and leverage Next.js features to ensure fast load times without sacrificing visual impact.
