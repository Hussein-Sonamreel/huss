### Overview

Hussein Bakes is a local bakery brand with excellent products but no online presence. I was tasked with creating their entire digital footprint from scratch. The project went beyond a simple website to include brand design, local search optimization, and a multi-platform social media strategy to drive customer engagement and sales.

### The Challenge

The core challenge was to establish a professional and discoverable online identity for a new local business. The goals were to:
- **Drive Local Foot Traffic:** Make the bakery easily findable for customers in the Kitui, Kenya area.
- **Build a Brand:** Design a memorable logo and a warm, inviting online presence.
- **Create a Digital Hub:** Provide a central place for customers to find the menu, contact information, and see the latest creations.

2.  **Web Development:** I built a fast, responsive, and mobile-first website using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The site was optimized for performance to ensure a smooth experience for users on any device.

3.  **Digital Ecosystem Creation:** The website was just the beginning. I set up and optimized the **Google Business Profile** for local SEO, and launched social media channels on **Facebook and Linktree** to create a community and market directly to customers.
